## Frequently Asked Questions

#### What is the relationship between USF Research Computing and the Health Informatics Institute?

In partnership with [USF Research Computing](http://www.rc.usf.edu/) the Health Informatics Institute
provides a specialized High Performance Computing Cluster to its research partners. USF Research Computing
maintains the overall infrastructure of the cluster ecosystem and HII presents a subset of these resources
to its faculty, staff, and external partners.

#### What is CIRCE and can I use its resources?

CIRCE is an acronym for the "Central Instructional and Research Computing Environment."
Although HII relies on a large part of the underlying CIRCE infrastructure, internal and external partners
of HII do not have direct access to CIRCE partitions and may only utilize HII [Partitions](pages/partitions.html).
