## [HII-HPC Cluster](../hii-hpc.html)

### FAQ

#### 1. What is the purpose of the HII-HPC Cluster?

The HII-HPC Cluster is a specialized set of compute resources offerred
to facilitate Bioinformatics research for large-scale workloads.

#### 2. What is the relationship between the HII-HPC Cluster and CIRCE?

CIRCE, the "Central Instructional and Research Computing Environment",
is the high-performance computing infrastructure provided by
[USF Research Computing](http://www.usf.edu/it/research-computing/)
for all faculty, students, staff, and partners.

The [HII-HPC Cluster](../hii-hpc.html) represents a specialized subset of resources
integrating into the overall CIRCE environment providing the unique requirements of
high-throughput bioinformatics as a workload.

Because of this specialization, please use the [HII Compute Portal Documentation](https://usf-hii.github.io/)
as the authoritative source for accessing and running jobs on the HII-HPC Cluster
as documentation referring to the overall CIRCE environment (e.g. https://cwa.rc.usf.edu/) may have
inconsistencies.

#### 3. What resources are available on the HII-HPC Cluster?

Since resources are being added to the cluster on a continual basis, the most accurate way to determine
available resources is by logging into the head node, `hii.rc.usf.edu`, and referring to
the `sinfo` example [HERE](sinfo.html#show-all-hii-hpc-resources) to obtain the most current information.
