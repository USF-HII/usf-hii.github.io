## [HII-HPC Cluster](../hii-hpc.html)

### FAQ

#### 1. What is the purpose of the HII-HPC Cluster?

The HII-HPC Cluster is a specialized set of compute resources offerred
to facilitate Bioinformatics research too large for desktop computation.

Once research has been conducted and general computational patterns established, please submit
the distributed computational work for high-scale workloads via the command-line on `hii.rc.usf.edu`.

If interested in GUI access to the cluster (via `X11` or `X2Go`) please note
if you do not reside on the USF Tampa, Florida Campus, the access you receive

and any remote GUI access al desktop experience.

#### 2. What is the relationship between the HII-HPC Cluster and CIRCE?

CIRCE, the "Central Instructional and Research Computing Environment",
is the high-performance computing infrastructure provided by
[USF Research Computing](http://www.usf.edu/it/research-computing/)
for all faculty, students, staff, and partners.

The [HII-HPC Cluster](../hii-hpc.html) represents a specialized subset of resources
integrating the overall CIRCE environment while providing the unique requirements of
high-throughput bioinformatics as a workload.

#### 3. What resources are available on the HII-HPC Cluster?

Since resources are being added to the cluster on a continual basis, the most accurate way to determine
available resources is by logging into the head node, `hii.rc.usf.edu`, and referring to
the `sinfo` documentation [here](sinfo.html) to obtain the most current information.
