## [HII-HPC Cluster](../hii-hpc.html)

### X2Go for Graphical Access

The HII-HPC Cluster is inherently a Linux Command-Line Interface (CLI) environment and
its computational resources are best accessed via that mode.

Although not generally recommended, HII provides special instructions below to utilized the X2Go software
to accomodate special cases requiring access to graphical applications on the cluster.

---

**Please note other than the initial X2Go session, all graphical applications
must be run on a compute node and not the `hii.rc.usf.edu` head node as this will cause issues
with other command-line based users.**

X2Go software is available [HERE](http://wiki.x2go.org/doku.php)
