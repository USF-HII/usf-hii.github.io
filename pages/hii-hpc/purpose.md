## [HII-HPC Cluster](../hii-hpc.html)

### Purpose

The purpose of the HII-HPC Cluster is to provide High Performance
Computing resources to faculty and partners conducting bioinformatics
research.

### Is HII-HPC right for me?

High Performance Computing has:

- A negative trade-off by adding more complexity.
- A positive trade-off by providing the possibility of solving problems that
  would otherwise never be achieved in reasonable time.

The HII-HPC may be right for you if you fit any of these criteria:

*I need to solve problems...*

- **Too large for a workstation** that can only be solved by many processes working in parallel.
  Enough processors and memory working together can often solve a problem
  in hours or days that would take months or years on a workstation.
- **Possible on a workstation**,
  but when many combinations of inputs and parameters are
  required only a parallel approach can provide a solution
  in a reasonable time.
- **Requiring large, fast storage**. While one can buy large inexpensive disks off
  the shelf, these are not particularly fast, and they may
  not be reliable enough under long running and intense I/O.
- **Local to the data.**
  Bioinformatics data can range from Gigabytes
  to many Terabytes in size. As the size of the data increases,
  transfer times may requires weeks or months to copy to local storage
  and compute resources.
