## [HII-HPC Cluster](../hii-hpc.html)

### Purpose

The purpose of the HII-HPC Cluster is to provide High Performance
Computing resources to faculty and partners conducting bioinformatics
research.

Use cases for the HII-HPC Cluster include:

- The need to solve problems too large for a workstation
  that can only be solved by many processes working in parallel.
  Enough processors and memory working together can often solve a problem
  in hours or days that would take months or years on a workstation.

- The need to solve problems possible on a workstation,
  but when many combinations of inputs and parameters are
  required only a parallel approach can provide a solution
  in a reasonable time.

- The need to solve problems requiring very large and very fast
  disk storage. While one can buy large inexpensive disks off
  the shelf, these are not particularly fast, and they may
  not be reliable enough under long running and intense I/O.

- The convenience of access to computing resources close to the data.
  Bioinformatics data can range from Gigabytes
  to many Terabytes in size. As the size of the data increases,
  transfer times may requires weeks or months to complete.
