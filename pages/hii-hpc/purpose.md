## [HII-HPC Cluster](../hii-hpc.html)

### Purpose

The purpose of the HII-HPC Cluster is to provide High Performance
Computing resources to faculty and partners conducting bioinformatics
research.

### Is HII-HPC right for me?

High Performance Computing has a:

- Negative trade-off adding more complexity.
- Positive trade-off providing the possibility of solving problems that
  would otherwise never be achieved in reasonable time.

The HII-HPC may be right for you if you fit any of these criteria:

*I need to solve problems...*

- **Too large for a workstation**. Some problems can only be solved by many processes working in parallel
  or by a system with very [high-memory capacity](himem-nodes.html).
  A large set of compute nodes working together can often solve a problem
  in hours or days that would take months or years on a workstation.
- **Possible on a workstation**.
  But when many combinations of inputs and parameters are
  required only a parallel approach can provide a solution
  in reasonable time.
- **Requiring large, fast storage**. While one can buy large inexpensive disks off
  the shelf, these are not particularly fast, and they may
  not be reliable enough under long running and intense I/O.
- **Local to the data.**
  Bioinformatics data can range from Gigabytes
  to many Terabytes in size. As the size of the data increases,
  transfer times may require weeks or months to copy locally.
