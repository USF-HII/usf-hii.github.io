## [HII/CIRCE Cluster](../hii-rc.html)

### FAQ

#### 1. What is the relationship between CIRCE and the HII/CIRCE Cluster?

CIRCE, the "Central Instructional and Research Computing Environment",
is the high-performance computing infrastructure provided by [USF Research Computing](http://www.usf.edu/it/research-computing/)
for USF faculty, students, and partners.

The HII/CIRCE Cluster is a specialized subset integrating HII resources into the overall CIRCE environment.
As a result, certain capabilities and documentation relating to the overall CIRCE environment
at the [Research Computing Cluster Web Access System](https://cwa.rc.usf.edu) may not apply to this specialized cluster.

Please refer to the documentation on the [USF HII Compute Portal](https://usf-hii.github.io) for the most
accurate information with regards to the HII/CIRCE Cluster.
