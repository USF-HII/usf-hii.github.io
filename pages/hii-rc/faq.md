## [CIRCE-HII Cluster](../hii-rc.html)

### FAQ

#### 1. What is the relationship between CIRCE and the CIRCE-HII Cluster?

CIRCE, the "Central Instructional and Research Computing Environment",
is the high-performance computing infrastructure provided by [USF Research Computing](http://www.usf.edu/it/research-computing/)
for USF faculty, students, and partners.

The CIRCE-HII Cluster is a specialized subset integrating HII resources into the overall CIRCE environment.
As a result, some documentation referring to [CIRCE](https://cwa.rc.usf.edu) may not be applicable to this specialized cluster.

Please refer to the documentation on the [USF HII Compute Portal](https://usf-hii.github.io) for the most
accurate information with regards to the CIRCE-HII Cluster.
