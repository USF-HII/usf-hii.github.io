## [HII/RC Cluster](../hii-rc.html)

### FAQ

#### 1. What is the relationship between CIRCE and the HII/RC Cluster?

CIRCE stands for the [USF Research Computing](http://www.usf.edu/it/research-computing/)
"Central Instructional and Research Computing Environment"
providing Big-Scale computational resources for faculty and partners of USF.

The HII/RC Cluster is a special segment of CIRCE combining
a series of HII grants into supplementary computational and storage
components integrated into the overall CIRCE environment providing the maximum of both expertise and assets.

With this consideration, HII provides their own documentation set (https://usf-hii.github.io) for usage of the HII/RC cluster
although general documentation is available at https://cwa.rc.usf.edu. Please understand that
a portion of the documentation at the general site may not apply to HII Partners.
