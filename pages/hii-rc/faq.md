## [HII/RC Cluster](../hii-rc.html)

### FAQ

#### 1. What is the relationship between CIRCE and the HII/RC Cluster?

CIRCE stands for the [USF Research Computing](http://www.usf.edu/it/research-computing/)
"Central Instructional and Research Computing Environment"
providing Big-Scale computational resources assisting faculty and partners of USF in their research.

The HII/RC Cluster is a special segment of CIRCE combining
a series of HII grants into supplementary computational and storage
components integrated into the overall CIRCE environment providing the maximum of both expertise and assets.

The one consideration from a usage perspective is, although a large portion of the CIRCE documentation
(available at https://cwa.rc.usf.edu/) has relevant information, the special nature of the HII/RC Cluster
has special customizations which may confuse general reading of the documentation.
