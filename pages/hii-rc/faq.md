## [HII/RC Cluster](../hii-rc.html)

### FAQ

#### 1. What is the relationship between CIRCE and the HII/RC Cluster?

**CIRCE** is the acronym for the "Central Instructional and Research Computing Environment"
provided by [Research Computing](http://www.usf.edu/it/research-computing/) at the University of South Florida.

**CIRCE** is an overall high-performance computing environment provided to all departments
at USF who require scalable computation to facilitate their research.

The HII/RC Cluster is a special segment of **CIRCE**
combining computational and storage systems via HII grants integrated into the overall **CIRCE** environment
for the maximum computation assets for HII faculty, staff, and external analytical partner workloads.

The one consideration from a usage perspective is, although a large portion of the **CIRCE** documentation
(available at https://cwa.rc.usf.edu/) has relevant information, the special nature of the HII/RC Cluster
has special customizations which may confuse general reading of the documentation.
