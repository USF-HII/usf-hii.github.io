## [HII/RC Cluster](../hii-rc.html)

### FAQ

#### 1. What is the relationship between CIRCE and the HII/RC Cluster?

CIRCE stands for "Central Instructional and Research Computing Environment"
provided by [USF Research Computing](http://www.usf.edu/it/research-computing/)
when Big-Scale computational resources are requested from faculty, staff, and partners of USF.

The HII/RC Cluster is a special segment of CIRCE
combining computational and storage systems via HII grants integrated into the overall CIRCE environment
to provide the maximum of computational expertise and assets.

The one consideration from a usage perspective is, although a large portion of the CIRCE documentation
(available at https://cwa.rc.usf.edu/) has relevant information, the special nature of the HII/RC Cluster
has special customizations which may confuse general reading of the documentation.
