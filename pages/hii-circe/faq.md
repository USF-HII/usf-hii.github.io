## [HII-CIRCE Cluster](../hii-circe.html)

### FAQ

#### 1. What is the relationship between CIRCE and the HII-CIRCE Cluster?

CIRCE, the "Central Instructional and Research Computing Environment",
is the high-performance computing infrastructure provided by
[USF Research Computing](http://www.usf.edu/it/research-computing/)
for faculty, students, staff, and partners.

The [HII-CIRCE Cluster](../hii-circe.html) represents a specialized subset of resources
integrated into the overall CIRCE environment with the unique requirements of high-throughput bioinformatics as a workload.

#### 2. What resources are available on the HII-CIRCE Cluster?

Since resources are being added to the cluster on a continual basis, the most accurate way to determine
available resources is by logging into the head node, `hii.rc.usf.edu`, and referring to
the `sinfo` documentation [here](sinfo.html) to obtain the most current information.
